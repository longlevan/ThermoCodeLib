<p>
First release of the library.
</p>
<p>
This version contains basic models for modeling building HVAC systems.
It also contains new medium models in the package
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Media\">Buildings.Media</a>. These medium models
have simpler property functions than the ones from
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media\">Modelica.Media</a>. For example,
there is medium model with constant heat capacity which is often sufficiently
accurate for building HVAC simulation, in contrast to the more detailed models
from <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media\">Modelica.Media</a> that are valid in
a larger temperature range, at the expense of introducing non-linearities due
to the medium properties.
