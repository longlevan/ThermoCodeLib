 Enumeration that defines the heat exchanger construction.

The following heat exchanger configurations are available in this enumeration:

<table summary=\"summary\" border=\"1\">
<tr><th>Enumeration</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>ParallelFlow</td><td>Parallel flow</td></tr>
<tr><td>CounterFlow</td><td>Counter flow</td></tr>
<tr><td>CrossFlowUnmixed</td><td>Cross flow, both streams unmixed</td></tr>
<tr><td>CrossFlowStream1MixedStream2Unmixed</td><td>Cross flow, stream 1 mixed, stream 2 unmixed</td></tr>

<tr><td>ConstantTemperaturePhaseChange</td><td>Constant temperature phase change in one stream</td></tr>

<p>
Note that for a given heat exchanger, the
 <code>HeatExchangerConfiguration</code> is fixed. However, if the capacity
 flow rates change, then the
 <a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.Types.HeatExchangerFlowRegime\">
 Buildings.Fluid.Types.HeatExchangerFlowRegime</a> may change. For example,
 a counter flow heat exchanger has <code>HeatExchangerConfiguration=CounterFlow</code>,
 but the <a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.Types.HeatExchangerFlowRegime\">
 Buildings.Fluid.Types.HeatExchangerFlowRegime</a> can change to parallel flow if one of the two capacity flow rates reverts
 its direction.
