%% Pre-defined functions
% Matlab has a variety of pre-defined functions readily available of use by
% simply using their names and providing the righ number and type of
% arguments. Example below
a = log(-5.2);
%% Functions defined by m files
% function [assignment_variables(s)] = function_name(arguments)
% Here, function is a required Matlab particle to identify the file as a
% function
