<h1>What platform-independent GUI toolkits exist for Python</h1>
<body>
Depending on what platform(s) you are aiming at, there are several. Some of them haven't been ported to Python 3 yet.At
leat Tkinter and Qt are know to be Python 3-compatible

<h2>Tkinter</h2>
<body>Standard builds of Python include an object-oriented interface to the Tcl/Tk widget set, called tkinter. This is
probably the easiest to install (since it comes included with most binary distributions of Python) and use. For more
info about Tk, including pointers to the source, see Tcl/Tk home page. Tcl/Tk is fully portable to the Mac OS X, Windows
and Unix platforms.
